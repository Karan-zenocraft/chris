What skills I need for make it working Good day guys, just started using Debian, everything is fine till now, but I am using Ethernet connection to the web as my Wi-Fi adapter driver is missing, I&#39;ve ran lspci | grep Network as I was advised in my previous topic and it showed me my network controller as: Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377 802.  When I start laptop, internet connection only showing LAN icon with red cross on it.  If you want to build this module manually, below are the instructions, assuming that: gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf toolchain is installed on your system (available for Debian/Ubuntu) The kernel source tree you want to build against is located under &lt;kernel_path&gt; Look for the ath5k module, located in the package linux-backports-modules-intrepid. 04 QCA9377 and no wireless network adapter Ubuntu 15.  I have ideapad 110-15IBR laptop and it have strange problem. 11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax networks.  I was trying to Flash ROM using QFIL.  While searching for other threads on this subject I stumbled across this recent thread about kernels, and I installed the 4. 5 Bluetooth V4.  The 14” FHD IPS touch display also boasts a 9. qca9377 linux driver<br><br>

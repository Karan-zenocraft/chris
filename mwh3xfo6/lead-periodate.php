Periodate modification of the sugar moiety in sugars, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), has previously been employed in order to prepare dialdehyde-type reagents, which were then utilized in crosslinking reactions on haemoglobin, yielding polymerized material with useful dioxygen-binding properties and hence proposed as possible artificial oxygen carriers (‘blood substitutes’).  The obtained results show that a fast but limited attack of periodate occurs in the amorphous region of cellulose, causing the decrease of degree of polymerisation to its levelling-off value.

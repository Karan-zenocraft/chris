It is a simple robot that could explain the concept of Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV) to newbie robot makers.  2 cm or 3/4 in) dark line if you have a white or light surface, or a white line if you have a dark surface. php 5 thoughts on “ Line Follower V2 ” moh 04/11/2018 at 20:29.  DIY Line Follower Sensor Array: In this Instructable you&#39;ll learn how to make your very own Line follower sensor array!!It consists of two parts : The IR LED board.  When the robot goes forward in a straight line (Situation 1), both light sensors see white and both motors go forward.  Following the line using more than one light sensor.  The purpose of this project is to build a Line Follower Robot with PID control.  Learn how to make a PID line follower with two EV3 color sensors. 525 mm).  The simplest way to make the GoPiGo3 follow a line with the Line Follower Sensor is by having a controller that can output 3 different states: one for the left, one for the center when it’s properly aligned and another one for the right.  The electronic circuitry of the robot consists of the Arduino board, IR sensor array and L293D motor driver IC coupled with two geared DC motors.  Ultrasonic sensor circuit and line follower circuit are both easily available on the net, the only thing that needs to be done is integrate the two, which can be done with a transistor driver circuit. i too use the same and convert the analog sensor output via a comparator into a digital output and feed the micro-controller(i am using atmel 8051).  Print the other byte and see what its shows you! – Chad G May 21 &#39;18 at 23:13 This is a simple tutorial to make a line follower robot using arduino. 8 sensor line follower code<br><br>

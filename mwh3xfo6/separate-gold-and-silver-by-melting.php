Put it with solid aluminium and a mild flame and you get thermite.  They used blowpipes made from fire-resistant clay to heat the smelting furnace.  Gold Melting Gold Melting is powerful app for all the Gold Smiths to calculate melting of gold.  We want pure gold, but gold-bearing rocks include lots of other materials such as quartz, calcite and the sulfides of other metals.  Silver is the most common of the precious metals.  These alloys (like Sterling silver and coin metal) tend to melt at lower temperatures than pure Silver, but they do not separate with simple fluxes.  How you separate them is also dependent on the form are they filings? Assuming the ring has a mass of 12 to 15 grams, based on a comparable size of a gold ring, one would need 2 to 2.  I have been a fine goldsmith for over forty years.  a company that historically made silver/gold ingots, bars and coins went bankrupt recently.

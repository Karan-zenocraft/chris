For the correct connection check wires colors: (Red for +, Blue for -, Black for GND) on the adapter. org.  Modbus has been a standard for interfacing remote I/O and PLCs into the process DLC system for over 20 years, allowing most legacy control systems to interface easily with Modbus.  Example of Modbus configuration in DEXGate2: In DEXGate2, you can use both Modbus-RTU and Modbus-TCP at the same time. 5 V).  Connect a cable from a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) or a PC to the 3-pin terminal strip of the CSC200 labeled the Installation Guideline for Cabling and Assembly being added now? The answer is very simple: The existing documents have been created at different times and therefore feature a different structure.  A Modbus RS485 interface can have multiple slaves on a bus network.  A transceiver control pin is optional since there is automatic ones.  I didn&#39;t find an easy way to code it in Shortcut so I need to write it myself but I don&#39;t know where to start.  Modbus is a simple yet powerful industry standard protocol that was originally developed by Modicon systems for transmitting/receiving information over serial links.  I used the TCP Master config example in the help file for modbus tcp and running a modbus bus monitor shows a connection being made but no actual communications happening.  In view of saving There are 8 wires on a standard UTP/STP cable and each wire is color-coded.  There are 8,211 rs485 cable suppliers, mainly located in Asia.

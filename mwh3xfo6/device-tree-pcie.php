The answer is a bit confusing: 1) in PCI &quot;device number&quot; actually means &quot;slot number&quot; (and it makes sense), 2) you say &quot;PCIe is totally different&quot; and &quot;since each device has its own independent set of wires, the device IDs are essentially all hard-coded&quot;, which means the set of wires (= the slot) has the ID hard-coded to it, thus it is the same as in PCI. d.  What APIs is the device manager calling to do this? What APIs would I use to only re-enumerate from a certain point in the device tree (say for example refresh all &quot;display monitor&quot; devices)? Thanks the tree showing all the PCIe devices residing below the selected bridge in the PCI hierarchy.  The timeout range is selectable.  I&#39;ve changed the device tree entries as follows, but cannot get the Linux SDK V1.  ❑PCI domain structure.  They reside at the bottom of the branches of the tree topology and only implement a single Upstream Port (facing toward the Root).  The data structure itself is a simple tree of named nodes and properties.  PCItree is a graphical Windows tool to look at all the hardware devices of the PCIbus.  How to have device tree output showing hardware paths? For this, use the -short command line option.

In XML and XHTML, characters can be expressed as hexadecimal numeric character references using the notation &amp;#xcode;, where the x denotes that code is a hex code point (of 1- to 6-digits) assigned to the character in the Unicode standard.  Once SAS assigns a type to a variable, it remains.  Technically, strings aren&#39;t true scalars--a string is a sequence of characters, and you can access individual characters and manipulate strings with a function that operates on sequences.

For high-pressure acid gas treatment, H 2S removal efﬁciency will be more sensitive to gas-side mass transfer, since H 2S reacts instantaneously with amine-based solvent, and, due to high-pressure operation, the column design will consider diameter optimisation as more important than height and not satisfactorily predict the pressure drop of bed consist-ing of non-uniform and non-spherical particles.  Generalized pressure drop correlation (GDPC) for randomly packed towers (Seader and Henley, 1996).  I’ve written about the fact that sometimes you have to say goodbye to a person with a mental illness for the sake of your own health and sometimes even for the sake of the person with the mental illness.  In this study, a simple generalized pressure drop correlation (GPDC) which is easier than existing approaches requiring more complicated and longer computations is developed for sizing randomly packed fractionation columns for pressure drops up to 150 mm water per meter of packing.  The bed was packed to heights of 4, 6, 8, and 10 inches and a thermocouple cross and a Datalogger were used to collect the radial temperature profiles at each height.

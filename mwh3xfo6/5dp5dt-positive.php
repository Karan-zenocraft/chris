Technically there&#39;s still hope until beta. 5dp5dt or 3dp5dt, depending who you talk to.  The grade before… I poas at 5dp5dt.  6dp5dt 15 (which felt low!) 8dp5dt 30 (but it doubled!) 10dp5dt 115 (we were in the clear!) I could not believe he stuck! Porter was meant to be with us.  Below is the light FRER from 4dp5dt at 11 AM, and the FRER from 5dp5dt at 8 AM (FMU).  Every source says it&#39;s possible but rare to test positive for pregnancy this early.  I told him I was just testing, and he didn’t even ask me what the result was until the next morning! Then I took another one and it was negative, the next morning to took another one and it was also a very faint positive. 5dp5dt positive<br><br>

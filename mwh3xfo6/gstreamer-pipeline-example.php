<p> They have a glretrace software that replay a trace file.  Here the video source is a video4linux2 device. org.  Generally, a mixed media pipeline will consist of a demuxer (to split audio and video), individualized pipelines per video stream and audio stream, and queue elements to provide asynchronous playback of each stream type (which basically The trace file can be replay in later time, and they got a nice gui for checking all the gl call every frame, with introspection.  I use the pipeline below to test changes to the framerate plugin that I am working on. 0 -v v4l2src ! video/x-raw,width=320,height=240 ! videoconvert ! jpegenc ! rtpjpegpay ! udpsink host=192.
